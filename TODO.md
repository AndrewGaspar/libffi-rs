# To do

  - Make build process portable from my computer to other computers.
  - Many more tests and examples.

  - ClosureOnce!
  - Do we need to use `std::thread::catch_panic` somewhere?
  - Custom complex number types? But Rust doesnâ€™t support complex numbers
    anyway...
  - CIF inspection?
